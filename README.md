### Built with

### What I learned

I always thought that i knew more than enough about css, but this challenge shattered my belief, i learnt how important being able to use query selector is and without it your css skills are not enough, i also learned how to use react-router-dom to navigate and fetch query params, they made the task easy and quick.
